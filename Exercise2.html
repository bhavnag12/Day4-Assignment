      Every Web Developer must have a basic understanding of 
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Take a good look at it, especially the new 
      array functions in JavaScript. While we know the name JavaScript, it 
      is ECMAScript, the language standard that defines new features, 
      capabilities and the evolution of this language.

     In web technology, a database is a structured collection of data that is stored electronically and accessed via a web application. 
    It serves as the backend component where data is stored, managed, and retrieved. 
    Databases can be relational (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) using structured tables and SQL for queries, or non-relational (like MongoDB, CouchDB) which store data in flexible, document-oriented formats
